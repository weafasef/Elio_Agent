/**
 * Prompt templates for the background memory extraction agent.
 *
 * The extraction agent runs as a perfect fork of the main conversation — same
 * system prompt, same message prefix. The main agent's system prompt always
 * has full save instructions; when the main agent writes memories itself,
 * extractMemories.ts skips that turn (hasMemoryWritesSince). This prompt
 * fires only when the main agent didn't write, so the save-criteria here
 * overlap the system prompt's harmlessly.
